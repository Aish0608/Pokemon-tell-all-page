      <h4 class="h41">Water</h4>
      <p>Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the three starter
        Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Water is the most
        common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

      <p>Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and Grass, which constitute the three starter
        Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Fire types are
        notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

      <p>Grass is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Water, which constitute the three starter
        Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.Grass is one of the
        weakest types statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are resistant to Grass moves.

      <h4 class="h42">Statistics of weight loss</h4>
      <p>The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process of getting out their
        doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of themselves. A Reddit Pokémon
        Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.

        million and most-downloaded in its first month of release. To date, it has grossed almost $2 billion in revenue
        and been downloaded 800 million times. Although no longer the global phenomenon it was in 2016, the game remains
        incredibly popular.

    <ol>
      <li class="l">What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into? </li>
      <ul class="u">
        <li class="l">We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of
          Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain.
          Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of
          electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon
          trainers should be able to answer.</li>
        <li class="l">Answer is Raichu</li>
      </ul>
      <li class="l">What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li>
      <ul class="u">
        <li class="l">Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but
          progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge
          in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're
          presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at
          all is required.
        </li>
        <li class="l">Answer is Master Ball</li>

        <h5>Type chart, effectiveness and weakness explained in Pokémon Go</h5>
        <p style="color:gray;">Pokémon battles appear in most forms of Pokémon media, being the central gameplay aspect

        <p style="color:gray;">Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon games, but the
          effect of those type matchups is slightly different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have
          slightly different multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought them
          slightly closer in line.
